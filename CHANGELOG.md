# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Serialize organization, member, and invitation timestamps at JavaScript's
  millisecond precision, preserving their dates in the official client.
- Use the TypeScript Better Auth 1.7.6 scrypt password format and NFKC
  normalization, so credentials can be imported between the two runtimes.
  Password length limits now count UTF-16 code units.
- Remove `Argon2Config` and `PasswordConfig::argon2_config`; the built-in scrypt
  parameters are fixed. Applications with existing hashes in another format
  need a password reset or an application-provided migration strategy.

## [1.0.0-alpha.3](https://github.com/better-auth-rs/better-auth-rs/compare/v1.0.0-alpha.2...v1.0.0-alpha.3) - 2026-09-26

### Bug Fixes

- upgrade jsonwebtoken past CVE-2026-25537 and drop proc-macro-error2 ([#109](https://github.com/better-auth-rs/better-auth-rs/pull/109))

- skip the semver check for the crates with exclusive TLS features ([#111](https://github.com/better-auth-rs/better-auth-rs/pull/111))


### CI

- drop debug info and stop triggering on the deleted v1 branch


### Chores

- leave the alpha.3 version bump to release-plz ([#110](https://github.com/better-auth-rs/better-auth-rs/pull/110))


### Documentation

- prepare the 1.0.0-alpha.3 release ([#108](https://github.com/better-auth-rs/better-auth-rs/pull/108))


### Features

- align with better-auth 1.6.29 ([#101](https://github.com/better-auth-rs/better-auth-rs/pull/101))


### Breaking changes

- **API keys are owned by a reference, not a user.** `apikey.user_id` is now
  `reference_id`, a `config_id` column is added, and the foreign key to
  `users` is gone: a reference may be an organization id. App-owned schemas
  must apply the equivalent change; `AuthApiKey::user_id` became
  `reference_id` plus `config_id`, and `ApiKeyStore::list_api_keys_by_user`
  became `list_api_keys_by_reference`. The bundled migrator upgrades
  existing installations in place; SQLite rebuilds the table because it
  cannot drop the constraint.
- **`GET /api-key/list` returns a paginated envelope** (`{ apiKeys, total,
  limit, offset }`) instead of a bare array, with `configId`, `limit`,
  `offset`, `sortBy` and `sortDirection` query parameters.
- **Error responses carry `code` only where upstream defines one.**
  `ErrorCodeMessageResponse::code` is `Option<String>`; ad-hoc messages
  omit the field, and codes such as `INVALID_CALLBACK_URL` now match
  upstream's constants rather than being derived from the message.
- **Implicit account linking requires a verified local email** by default
  (`account_linking.require_local_email_verified`); a callback that would
  have linked to an unverified local account now redirects with
  `account_not_linked`.
- `RolePermissions` (organization plugin) gained an `api_key` field, so
  struct literals must name it or use `..Default::default()`.

### Security

- Device authorization no longer approves or denies a code no signed-in
  session has claimed.
- `/organization/list-user-invitations` requires a verified email
  (`EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED_FOR_INVITATION`).
